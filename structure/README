Standard package for fitting the Structure model:
https://rajanil.github.io/fastStructure/

I made some changes in my branch:
https://github.com/rgiordan/fastStructure

In particular, I provide
read_bed_file.py
...which uses the fastStructure code to convert the bed format to a csv.

You need to run
sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev

Then run
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
... in the base fastStructure repo as well as in vars
