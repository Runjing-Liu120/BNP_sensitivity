For an easy example of running the optimization routine on STRUCTURE, see `structure_sandbox.ipynb`. 

After fitting models (see `../scripts/` to get fits), a single fit can be examined in `read_fit_results.ipynb`. If a suite of models were fit, 
the sensitivity is examined in in `read_parametric_sensitivity_results.ipynb`
