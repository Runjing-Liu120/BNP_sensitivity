Our approach has similarities to \citet{Basu:2000:BNP_robustness} who also
considers local robustness in Bayesian non-parametric models. They derive the
analytic derivative of some posterior quantity with respect to the DP prior
parameter $\alpha$. MCMC samples are then needed to evaluate the derivative.
They also consider the robustness with respect to the functional form of the
prior on the cluster means.  By viewing a posterior quantity as a functional of
the functional form of the prior, they evalaute Gateaux derivatives in various
directions to other priors.

In our approach, we analyze the sensitivity of the variational distribution, and
compute derivatives automatically from the KL objective. Moreover, we use the
derivatives not only for sensitivity, but for extrapolating posterior quantities
as they vary over prior parameters.
