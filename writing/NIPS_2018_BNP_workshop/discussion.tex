In this work, we fit a BNP model to cluster the Iris dataset, and investigated
the sensitivity of the expected number of posterior clusters to the choice of
stick-breaking prior. We proposed an approximate method that leverages automatic
differentiation tools to efficiently predict the effect of choosing different
stick-breaking priors. We show that for several types of prior perturbations, we
were able to provide a reasonable alternative to the expensive process of
re-fitting a variational posterior.
